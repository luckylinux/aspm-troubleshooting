# ASPM Script
I use a modified version of the Excellent [ASPM Script](https://github.com/0x666690/ASPM).

Note: based on some [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/debian/comments/8c6ytj/active_state_power_management_aspm/) User Comments, the Reason why "Unkown Register" Error shows up when using a Shell Script called `aspm-enabler` is because the `bc` Package was not installed.
